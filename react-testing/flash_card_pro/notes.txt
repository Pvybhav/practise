1. Create Store
2. Need atleast one reducer(--> updates the Store) for creating Store
3. The responsive messages --> actions
4. Reducer is dependent on action
5. 'actions' folder in 'src'
6. create 'index.js' inside 'actions' folder
7. action type is capitialized

const action = {
    type: 'SET_STACK',
    stack: stack
};


8. wrap the above code in function(stack data comes from function parameter) and return the action
9. create 'reducers' folder
10. create 'index.js' inside 'reducers' folder
11. reducer is a function, which contains two parameters i.e., one is state and another one is action
12. switch statement to execute the different actions by its type
13. the reducer function returns the empty object by default which is given as a parameter for state

function stack(state={}, action){
    switch(action.type){
        case 'SET_STACK': 
            return action.stack;
        default:
            return state;
    }
}
14. create action type as variable and use that variable inside actions and export it to use for other
15. import createStore and rootReducer(reducer folder) in 'index.js' file
